  "requirements": "Design the backend for a social media application. Core features include users posting content, seeing a personalized feed of content from people they follow, and being able to like and comment on posts. The feed should update in real-time. The system also needs a basic content moderation queue.",
  "planA": {
    "aiId": "AI-Alpha",
    "approach": "A highly decoupled, service-based architecture. The feed generation is separated from the user-generated content (UGC) and engagement actions.",

    "philosophyNotes": "Generating the feed on-read is much simpler and ensures the feed is always 100% up-to-date. It avoids the complexity of background workers and potential data staleness. For most apps, this is performant enough and much easier to maintain."
