  "requirements": "Develop a system for patients to schedule appointments with doctors. The system must handle doctors in different timezones and show availability in the patient's local time. It needs to send email and SMS reminders 24 hours before the appointment. Doctors must be able to block out times on their calendar.",
  "planA": {
    "aiId": "AI-Alpha",
    "approach": "A service-oriented approach with a clear separation between core scheduling logic and external communication.",

    ],
    "philosophyNotes": "By isolating notifications, we can easily swap providers (e.g., Twilio for SMS, SendGrid for email) or add new channels (like push notifications) without touching the core scheduling logic. This is a robust, decoupled design."

    "aiId": "AI-Beta",

    "philosophyNotes": "Notifications are an integral part of an appointment's lifecycle, not a separate domain. Integrating them simplifies the workflow and reduces the number of services to manage and deploy. It ensures reminders are transactionally tied to the appointment booking."
