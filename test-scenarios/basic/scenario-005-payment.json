  "requirements": "Design a payment processing system for an e-commerce site. It must be PCI compliant. When a payment is initiated, it should be checked by an external fraud detection service. The system must handle webhooks from the payment provider (e.g., Stripe) to confirm payment success or failure.",
  "planA": {
    "aiId": "AI-Alpha",
    "approach": "A fully asynchronous, event-driven architecture. The payment process is a long-running workflow (a saga) that coordinates between services.",
    "expectedComponents": [
      {"name": "PaymentInitiationService", "responsibilities": ["Provides an endpoint for the frontend to start a payment"]},
      {"name": "FraudDetectionService", "responsibilities": ["Calls the external fraud detection API"]},

      {"name": "WebhookHandlerService", "responsibilities": ["Receives and validates incoming webhooks"]},

    ],
    "philosophyNotes": "Payments are not instantaneous. By modeling the process as an asynchronous saga, the system is highly resilient. A failure in the fraud service doesn't block new payment initiations, and the orchestrator can handle retries and compensation logic gracefully."
  },
  "planB": {
    "aiId": "AI-Beta", 
    "approach": "A simpler, more synchronous approach. The API call to initiate a payment handles the fraud check directly and returns a pending status. A separate, isolated process handles the webhooks.",
    "expectedComponents": [
      {"name": "PaymentService", "responsibilities": ["Exposes a 'charge' endpoint that internally calls the fraud service and then the payment provider. It creates a 'pending' payment record in the database."]},

      {"name": "create-charge", "type": "synchronous-api"},
      {"name": "handle-stripe-webhook", "type": "webhook"}
    ],
    "philosophyNotes": "For the user, the payment initiation *feels* synchronous. This is a simpler mental model. The complexity of long-running processes is avoided. The webhook processor is a simple, stateless function that updates a database record, making it easy to test and deploy."
