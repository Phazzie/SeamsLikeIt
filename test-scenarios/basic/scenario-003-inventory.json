  "requirements": "Design a system for real-time inventory management for a warehouse. It must track stock levels for thousands of products. When stock for a product drops below a certain threshold, an alert must be sent to the purchasing department. The system also needs to integrate with supplier APIs to get estimated restocking times.",
  "planA": {
    "aiId": "AI-Alpha",
    "approach": "An event-sourcing architecture where every change to inventory is recorded as an immutable event (e.g., 'ItemsAdded', 'ItemsRemoved'). The current state is derived by replaying these events.",
