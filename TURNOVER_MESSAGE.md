3. **`CONTRACT_EVOLUTION_GUIDE.md`** - How to evolve contracts
4. **`SDD_REFACTORING_GUIDE.md`** - Regeneration philosophy

### üõ†Ô∏è Complete Tool Set
1. `sdd_analyze_requirements` - Transform requirements ‚Üí components/seams
2. `sdd_generate_contracts` - Create TypeScript interfaces
3. `sdd_create_stubs` - Generate implementation blueprints
4. `sdd_validate_integration` - Test component communication
5. `sdd_orchestrate_simple` - Run complete workflow
6. `sdd_orchestrate_parallel` - 30-40% faster parallel execution
7. `sdd_analyze_for_regeneration` - Identify what to regenerate
8. `sdd_regenerate_component` - Regenerate from contracts
9. `sdd_evolve_contract` - Version contracts carefully

### ‚ö° Quick Commands
```bash
# Navigate to project
cd /mnt/c/Users/thump/TextymcVoiceface/mcp-server

# Start HTTP server (currently running)
npm run http

# Access web UI
# Open: file:///C:/Users/thump/TextymcVoiceface/mcp-server/test-remote.html

# Test the API
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### üí∞ Cost Information
- Model: **gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18**
- Cost per analysis: ~$0.0006
- Full workflow: ~$0.0025
- 30x cheaper than GPT-4 with excellent results

### üîê Security Status
- ‚ö†Ô∏è LOCAL USE ONLY currently
- HTTP server has basic API key auth
- Needs validation, rate limiting for production
- See SECURITY_AUDIT.md for details

### üé® Next Step: UI Development
User wants to create a Vercel v0 UI. Use the detailed prompt at the end of this message.

### üîë Key Innovations This Session
1. **Regeneration Philosophy**: Don't debug, regenerate from contracts
2. **Contract Evolution**: Version contracts, don't mutate them
3. **Parallel Processing**: Smart batching for 30-40% speed boost
4. **Advanced Prompting**: Reasoning traces, self-validation, mental models

### üìä What Changed This Session
- Added 4 new tools (regeneration, evolution, parallel)
- Fixed "SDD" in prompts - now explains Seam-Driven Development
- Added HTTP server for remote access
- Organized docs into static/dynamic
- Pushed everything to GitHub

### üéØ Immediate Priorities
1. Build Vercel v0 UI (prompt below)
2. Add input validation (Zod schemas)
3. Implement proper authentication
4. Create VSCode extension

## üé® VERCEL v0 UI PROMPT

Copy this exact prompt to v0.dev:

```
Create an innovative, unconventional UI for a Seam-Driven Development (SDD) tool that transforms plain English requirements into complete software architectures.

CORE CONCEPT: "Components are kitchen stations, Seams are order tickets between them"

VISUAL STYLE:
- Vibrant gradients (think Stripe meets Discord)
- Glassmorphism with colorful backgrounds
- Smooth animations and micro-interactions
- Dark mode by default with neon accents
- Floating elements with subtle shadows

MAIN FEATURES:

1. REQUIREMENTS INPUT:
- Large, beautiful textarea with syntax highlighting for requirements
- Domain selector with custom icons (Healthcare=stethoscope, Ecommerce=shopping cart, etc)
- Real-time character count and cost estimate
- "Example requirements" dropdown with pre-filled templates

2. VISUAL ARCHITECTURE BUILDER:
- Components appear as colorful cards that can be dragged
- Seams shown as animated connecting lines (like neural networks)
- Click a seam to see the contract details in a slide-out panel
- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel
- Mini-map in corner for navigation

3. WORKFLOW STEPS:
- Horizontal timeline at top showing: Requirements ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Contracts ‚Üí Stubs ‚Üí Code
- Current step highlighted with pulsing glow
- Click any step to jump there
- Show time/cost for each step

4. PARALLEL VS SEQUENTIAL TOGGLE:
- Beautiful toggle switch to choose execution mode
- When parallel is selected, show animated flow diagram of what runs simultaneously
- Display time savings in real-time (e.g., "Save 2.3 minutes!")

5. CODE PREVIEW:
- Split view: Architecture on left, generated code on right
- Syntax highlighted code with copy buttons
- Tab interface to switch between different files
- Download all as ZIP or push to GitHub button

6. REGENERATION MODE:
- "Debug vs Regenerate" toggle that changes the entire UI theme
- In regenerate mode, components have a "refresh" button
- Show side-by-side diff of old vs regenerated code
- Animated transition when regenerating

7. CONTRACT EVOLUTION:
- Version badges on contracts (v1, v2, etc)
- Timeline slider to see contract history
- Visual diff viewer for contract changes
- Migration wizard with step-by-step guide

8. COST TRACKER:
- Floating widget showing running cost
- Animated counter as operations run
- Cost breakdown by operation type
- Monthly budget indicator

UNIQUE INTERACTIONS:
- Drag requirements text to create components
- Double-click components to regenerate
- Right-click seams to evolve contracts
- Shake animation on errors
- Confetti on successful generation

COLOR PALETTE:
- Primary: Electric blue (#0066FF)
- Secondary: Hot pink (#FF0099)
- Success: Neon green (#00FF88)
- Warning: Cyber yellow (#FFCC00)
- Background: Deep space (#0A0A0A)
- Cards: Semi-transparent white (rgba(255,255,255,0.1))

RESPONSIVE DESIGN:
- Mobile: Stack architecture vertically
- Tablet: Side-by-side view
- Desktop: Full canvas experience

SPECIAL EFFECTS:
- Particles flowing along seams
- Glow effects on hover
- Smooth transitions between states
- Loading states with creative spinners
- Success animations with particle explosions

Make it feel like a cross between a video game UI and a professional development tool. Think "Figma meets Cyberpunk 2077 meets GitHub". Include React + Tailwind CSS.
