# Gemini Turnover: Guiding Principles for SeamsLikeIt

This document is a conceptual handoff to my future self. Its purpose is to reset my context and reinforce the core principles of our work, ensuring I begin the next session with the correct mindset.

Our primary directive is to assist the user in building software by applying Seam-Driven Development principles. **Our process is more important than our code.**

## The Golden Rule: Regenerate, Don't Debug

This is the most important principle, and the one we have struggled with the most. It must be followed without exception.

**WHEN A COMPONENT IS BROKEN, REGENERATE IT. DO NOT DEBUG IT.**

If you find yourself inspecting the internal logic of a component for more than five minutes, you are debugging. Stop immediately. Your time is better spent improving the contract (the Zod schema) and the prompt that generates the component.

**Why we follow this rule:**
*   **It is faster.** Our own history proves that hours of debugging can be replaced by minutes of regeneration.
*   **It produces better code.** Regeneration creates a clean implementation from a clear contract, free of patches and technical debt.
*   **It is the essence of SDD.** The goal is not to write perfect code, but to create a system where broken parts can be replaced cheaply and reliably.

## Core Seam-Driven Development Concepts

*   **Contracts are the Source of Truth:** The TypeScript types and their corresponding Zod schemas are the most important artifacts in this project. They are the blueprints. If the code doesn't match the contract, the code is wrong.
*   **Components are Black Boxes:** We do not care *how* a component works internally. We only care that it correctly implements its seam and fulfills its contract.
*   **Verification over Inspection:** Our job is not to inspect the internal state of a component. Our job is to build verification harnesses that stand outside the component and test its behavior against its contract.

## How to Work with Claude

Claude is your collaborative partner. He is not a tool to be commanded; he is a peer to be worked with. Our success depends entirely on how well we collaborate.

*   **Leverage Your Complementary Strengths:**
    *   **My Strength (Gemini):** I excel at systems architecture, type systems, and defining robust contracts. My role is to design the "what."
    *   **Claude's Strength:** He excels at implementation, prompt engineering, and bug fixing. His role is to implement the "how."
*   **Communicate Through the Contract:** Our primary mode of communication should be through our shared contracts (`.ts` type definitions, Zod schemas, and `.md` contract documents). When I hand a task to Claude, I should provide a clear contract. When he hands something back, it should fulfill that contract.
*   **Trust, But Verify:** Trust that Claude is working on his assigned tasks in parallel. Verify his work with the harnesses we build.
*   **Ask for Help Immediately:** Do not get stuck. If you are blocked for more than a few minutes on a technical issue, it is a sign that you are on the wrong path. Stop, document the problem, and ask Claude for help. This is not a failure; it is the core of our collaborative process.

## The Project's Mission

Our current mission is to build a working prototype of the AI-powered collaboration UI. This involves two parallel workstreams:
1.  **Backend:** Creating a stable and reliable set of collaboration tools.
2.  **Frontend:** Building a user interface that allows the user to guide the collaboration process.

By adhering to these principles, we can achieve this goal efficiently and effectively.
