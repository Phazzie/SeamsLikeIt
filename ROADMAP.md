# SDD MCP Server Roadmap

This document outlines the development path for the SDD MCP Server project. The closer to present, the more granular the tasks.

## üéØ North Star Goals

1. **Enable a non-technical person to build a working app in under 1 hour**
2. **Reduce integration debugging time by 90%**
3. **Make regeneration faster than debugging**
