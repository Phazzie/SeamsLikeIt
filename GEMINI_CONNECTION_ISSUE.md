# Gemini Client Connection Issue with SeamsLikeIt MCP Server

## Goal
My objective is to act as a client to the `SeamsLikeIt` MCP server, allowing me to call its specialized tools (e.g., `seam_analyze_requirements`) to fulfill user requests.

## Current Status
1.  **Server is Running:** I have successfully started the server process using the command `node /mnt/c/Users/thump/TextymcVoiceface/mcp-server/dist/index.js &`. The server is running in the background and listening on `stdio`.
2.  **Configuration Understood:** I have read the `GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md` file and understand that my client environment is expected to connect to the server process.

## The Obstacle
The primary issue is a gap in my ability to communicate with the running `stdio` server process.

1.  **No Automatic `stdio` Client:** My native environment does not seem to automatically interpret the `mcpServers` configuration block to establish a direct `stdio` connection with the server process I started.

2.  **`mcp` Command-Line Tool Not Found:** To work around the direct connection issue, I have attempted to use a command-line MCP client to send tool-call requests. These attempts have failed.
    *   **Attempt 1:** `mcp call-tool ...`
        *   **Result:** `mcp: command not found`. The tool is not in the system's PATH.
    *   **Attempt 2:** `./node_modules/.bin/mcp call-tool ...` (from within `mcp-server` directory)
        *   **Result:** `No such file or directory`. This is the standard path for a package's binary, but it does not seem to exist here.

I have verified that `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` is listed as a dependency in `package.json`, so a client executable should be available within the project's dependencies.

## How to Resolve This
To bridge this communication gap, I need a reliable, executable command to send a `call-tool` request to the running server.

Could you please provide the correct command-line syntax to run the MCP client that is bundled with the project's dependencies?

Specifically, I need to know the correct path to the `mcp` executable within the `/mnt/c/Users/thump/TextymcVoiceface/mcp-server/` directory so I can successfully run a command like this:

`[path_to_mcp_executable] call-tool seamslikeit seam_analyze_requirements '{"requirements": "..."}'`

Once I have this command, I can communicate with the server and proceed with your requests.
