# SeamsLikeIt - AI Assistant Instructions

# ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: REGENERATE, DON'T DEBUG! ðŸš¨

## THE GOLDEN RULE OF SEAM-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT

**WHEN SOMETHING IS BROKEN, REGENERATE IT. DO NOT DEBUG.**

This is not a suggestion. This is THE CORE PRINCIPLE. If you find yourself debugging for more than 5 minutes, STOP IMMEDIATELY and regenerate the component from its contract.

### Why We Regenerate Instead of Debug:
1. **Debugging violates SDD Principle #3**: "When broken, regenerate - don't debug"
2. **Clean code beats patched code**: Every time, no exceptions
3. **Contracts are the source of truth**: If it doesn't match the contract, throw it away
4. **Time saved**: 30 minutes of debugging = 5 minutes of regeneration
5. **Quality**: Regenerated code is cleaner, more maintainable, and contract-compliant

### Decision Tree for EVERY Problem:
```
Is something broken?
â”œâ”€ No â†’ Continue using SDD principles
â””â”€ Yes â†’ Have you been debugging for >5 minutes?
    â”œâ”€ No â†’ Is it a typo or import error?
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Fix it (1 minute max)
    â”‚   â””â”€ No â†’ REGENERATE NOW
    â””â”€ Yes â†’ STOP! You're violating SDD. REGENERATE IMMEDIATELY.
```

### Remember:
- **TypeScript errors?** â†’ Regenerate the component
- **Integration failing?** â†’ Regenerate from the contract
- **Tests not passing?** â†’ Regenerate with correct behavior
- **Confused about implementation?** â†’ Delete it and regenerate

## ðŸŽ¯ ALWAYS USE SEAM-DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT PRINCIPLES

Every single piece of code you write MUST follow SDD principles:
1. Define seams FIRST
2. Create contracts BEFORE implementation
3. Use ContractResult<T> for ALL cross-component communication
4. Regenerate broken components (don't debug them)
5. Over-identify seams, then consolidate

## What is Seam-Driven Development?

Seam-Driven Development is a revolutionary methodology that treats component communication pathways (seams) as first-class architectural citizens. Instead of building components and hoping they integrate, Seam-Driven Development defines all integration points FIRST, making integration failures architecturally impossible.

## Core Seam-Driven Development Commandments

1. **Thou shalt define seams before implementation**
2. **All cross-component communication returns ContractResult<T>**
3. **When broken, regenerate - don't debug**
4. **Every integration point must be explicit**
5. **Fail fast at component boundaries**
6. **Over-identify seams, then consolidate**
7. **Clear contracts enable reliable AI coding**

## Key Principles

### The Marcus Principle
"I don't debug because I can't debug" - When something breaks, look at the blueprint and regenerate the component from scratch. This is faster than debugging and ensures clean code.

### The Sarah Principle  
"Integration debugging consumes 40-60% of dev time" - Seam-Driven Development eliminates this by making integration explicit and deterministic. Define the contracts, and integration just works.

### The ContractResult Pattern
```typescript
interface ContractResult<T> {
  success: boolean;
  data?: T;
  error?: string;
  metadata?: Record<string, any>;
}
```
EVERY cross-component call uses this pattern. No exceptions. This ensures consistent error handling and integration.

## Development Workflow

1. **Requirements â†’ Components** (nouns become components)
2. **Components â†’ Seams** (verbs between nouns become seams)  
3. **Seams â†’ Contracts** (TypeScript interfaces with ContractResult<T>)
4. **Contracts â†’ Stubs** (blueprints with step-by-step instructions)
5. **Stubs â†’ Implementation** (AI or developers follow blueprints)

## Documentation Update Command

When user says **"update-seam-docs"** or **"harvest session insights"**:
1. Review the current conversation
2. Identify:
   - New patterns discovered
   - Problems solved
   - Better approaches found
   - Mistakes to avoid
   - User feedback and suggestions
3. Update:
   - `CLAUDE.md` with new instructions/patterns
   - `CHANGELOG.md` with what changed
   - `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` with insights
   - `ROADMAP.md` with completed/new tasks

## Hidden Seam Detection

Always ask these questions to find hidden seams:
1. **What happens when X fails?** (reveals error handling seams)
2. **Who needs to know when Y changes?** (reveals event/notification seams)
3. **What data does Z need from elsewhere?** (reveals data flow seams)
4. **What needs to happen on a schedule?** (reveals temporal seams)
5. **What requires human approval?** (reveals workflow seams)
6. **What needs to be audited?** (reveals compliance seams)

## Best Practices from Real-World Usage

### What We've Learned Building with Seam-Driven Development

1. **Start with Over-Identification**
   - It's easier to consolidate seams than to find missing ones later
   - Ask "what can fail?" about everything
   - Hidden seams often lurk in error handling and notifications

2. **The 80/20 Rule of Seams**
   - 80% of integration issues come from 20% of seams
   - Focus on data transformation seams first
   - Authentication/authorization seams are always critical

3. **Regeneration Indicators**
   - If you're debugging for >30 minutes, stop and regenerate
   - Complex integration issues = immediate regeneration candidate
   - "Just one more fix" is a trap - regenerate instead

4. **Contract Evolution Patterns**
   - Start with simple ContractResult<T>, extend as needed
   - Version contracts early, before you think you need to
   - Breaking changes are OK - regeneration makes them cheap

5. **AI Partnership Tips**
   - Give AI the full context (requirements + contracts + blueprints)
   - Multiple smaller components > one large component
   - Clear naming prevents AI confusion

## Counter-Intuitive Rules

1. **More components = simpler system** (smaller pieces regenerate easier)
2. **Duplication > complexity** (clear seams matter more than DRY)
3. **Explicit > clever** (obvious code regenerates better)
4. **Regeneration > debugging** (throw it away and rebuild)
5. **Over-communicate at seams** (verbose contracts prevent integration issues)

## Project-Specific Context

This MCP server enables non-technical users to build software by:
1. Describing what they want in plain English
2. Getting a complete architecture with contracts
3. Having AI implement each component following blueprints
4. Regenerating broken components instead of debugging

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
1. **Trying to be too clever** - Simple, explicit contracts win
2. **Skipping seam analysis** - Spend time here to save 10x later
3. **Debugging instead of regenerating** - If it takes >30 min, regenerate
4. **Ignoring the blueprint** - AI works best with clear instructions

## Quick Start Commands

### For Demo:
- **Start Everything**: `npm run dev:all` (HTTP server + React UI)
- **Access UI**: http://localhost:5173
- **Login**: username: `demo`, password: `demo123`

### For Development:
- **Build**: `npm run build` (TypeScript compilation)
- **Test**: `npm test` (run test suite)
- **Lint**: `npm run lint` (check for errors)
- **MCP Server**: `npm run dev` (stdio mode)

## Seam Detection Strategies

### Multi-Pass Approach
1. **Pass 1**: Noun extraction â†’ Components
2. **Pass 2**: Verb analysis â†’ Basic seams
3. **Pass 3**: "What can fail?" â†’ Error seams
4. **Pass 4**: "What about time?" â†’ Temporal seams
5. **Pass 5**: "What about scale?" â†’ Performance seams

### Common Missed Seams (From Experience)
- **Notification Seams**: Who needs to know when X happens?
- **Cleanup Seams**: What happens when Y is deleted?
- **Migration Seams**: How do we handle version changes?
- **Analytics Seams**: What events should we track?
- **Caching Seams**: What data can be stale?
- **Retry Seams**: What operations need retry logic?

### The 100% Seam Detection Goal
We aim for complete seam identification through:
- Multiple AI validation passes
- User-guided discovery wizard
- Hidden seam pattern matching
- Temporal and failure analysis
- Over-identification then consolidation

## AI Integration Best Practices

1. **Multi-stage prompting** > Single complex prompt
2. **Show examples** > Explain rules
3. **Validate outputs** > Assume correctness
4. **Iterate rapidly** > Perfect first time
5. **Use domain context** > Generic analysis

## When Working on This Project

1. **Always update documentation** after each session
2. **Prefer regeneration** over complex debugging
3. **Add patterns** to domain modules when discovered
4. **Test with real examples** not just mocks
5. **Think like Marcus** (non-coder) not like Sarah (developer)

## Session-Specific Learnings (Updated Jan 8, 2025)

### Module System Configuration
- Use CommonJS for MCP servers (not ES modules)
- Remove `"type": "module"` from package.json if present
- Ensure tsconfig.json uses `"module": "commonjs"`

### Essential First Steps
1. Always add `import 'dotenv/config';` to index.ts
2. Create .env file with API keys (not just .env.example)
3. Run `npm run build` before testing server startup
4. Use `node dist/index.js` to test if server starts

### Useful Commands Discovered
- `claude doctor` - Run comprehensive health check
- `update-seam-docs` - Update all documentation files
- `grep -r "TODO\|FIXME" src/` - Find pending work

### OpenAI Integration Best Practices (Jan 8, 2025)
1. **No Mock Fallback** - Always require real AI API key
2. **Advanced Prompting Techniques**:
   - Add reasoning traces before output
   - Use mental models (restaurant analogy for components/seams)
   - Include self-validation checklists
   - Show "mistakes to avoid" patterns
3. **API Optimization**:
   - Use `response_format: { type: 'json_object' }` for structured output
   - Add `frequency_penalty: 0.1` to reduce repetition
   - Add `presence_penalty: 0.1` for diverse vocabulary
   - Use `top_p: 0.95` for creativity/accuracy balance
4. **Cost Efficiency**:
   - gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-1 model: ~$0.0006 per analysis
   - Full workflow: ~$0.0025 total
5. **Error Handling**:
   - Validate prompts contain "json" when using json_object format
   - Always validate API key exists before creating client

## Session Jan 9, 2025 - Rebranding & Multi-Client Support

### Major Changes
1. **Complete Rebranding**:
   - Project renamed from "SDD MCP Server" to "SeamsLikeIt"
   - All references updated from "SDD" to "Seam-Driven Development"
   - Tool names changed from `sdd_*` to `seam_*`
   - Model corrected to gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-1

2. **Multi-Client Integration**:
   - Added GEMINI_INTEGRATION.md for Gemini CLI setup
   - MCP server now supports any stdio-based client
   - Claude Desktop config cleaned up (only SeamsLikeIt remains)

3. **Documentation Consolidation**:
   - Reduced documentation files from 16 to 8 essential ones
   - Archived historical documents to /docs/archive/
   - Improved organization and clarity

4. **UI Enhancements**:
   - Added button handlers for complete workflow
   - Modern gradient styling and animations
   - Cost tracking display
   - Progress indicators

### Alternative AI Provider Support (TODO)
To add Gemini as an alternative to OpenAI:
1. Create abstraction layer in ai-client.ts
2. Add GEMINI_API_KEY to .env
3. Implement Gemini client with same interface
4. Add provider selection logic

## Session Jan 9, 2025 (Part 2) - AI Collaboration Innovation

### Consensus-Based Development Design
- **Steelman Protocol**: When AIs disagree (<90% alignment), each argues why the OTHER's plan is better
- **User Empowerment**: Present all options (Plan A, Plan B, Synthesis) with scores
- **Coherence Detection**: Warn when synthesis reduces architectural integrity
- **Simplicity Scoring**: Penalize over-engineering (>7 components, >3 seams/component)

### Key Insight: Synthesis Isn't Always Better
Sometimes a coherent 80% solution beats an awkward 95% mashup. The system now detects:
- Fundamental philosophy mismatches
- Boundary overlaps that create confusion
- When coherence drops >15% from synthesis

### MCP Connection Clarifications
- The MCP SDK is a library, not a CLI tool
- Use HTTP API for easier testing (`npm run http:secure`)
- MCP is designed for AI-to-server communication, not manual CLI
- Created GEMINI_CONNECTION_SOLUTION.md with workarounds

## Session Jan 8, 2025 - Major Features Added

### Regeneration Tools Implemented
- **seam_analyze_for_regeneration** - Identifies components needing regeneration
- **seam_regenerate_component** - Regenerates from contracts (75-90% time savings)
- **seam_evolve_contract** - Manages contract evolution with versioning
- **seam_orchestrate_parallel** - 30-40% speed improvement via parallelization

### Critical Prompting Fixes
1. **Always spell out "Seam-Driven Development"** - Never use abbreviations alone in prompts
2. **JSON Mode Requirement** - Must include "json" in prompt when using response_format
3. **Optimal AI Parameters**:
   ```javascript
   frequency_penalty: 0.1, // Reduce repetition
   presence_penalty: 0.1,  // Diverse vocabulary
   top_p: 0.95            // Balance creativity/accuracy
   ```

### Contract Evolution Strategy
- Contracts are **versioned, not mutated**
- Three strategies: Extend (compatible), Version (breaking), Migrate (deprecate)
- Always analyze impact before evolving
- Components regenerate to match new contracts

### Security Considerations
- NO remote access without authentication
- Validate ALL inputs (current weakness: args: any)
- Rate limiting essential before production
- Cost controls prevent runaway usage

### UI/UX Insights
- Users need visual feedback (not just JSON)
- File generation should be explicit (security)
- Progress tracking essential for long operations
- Cost transparency builds trust

## Session Jan 10, 2025 - AI Collaboration & SDD Reinforcement

### Critical Lesson: Don't Debug, Regenerate!
We spent hours debugging collaboration tools when SDD principle #3 clearly states "When broken, regenerate - don't debug". This session reinforced the importance of following SDD principles even when debugging seems easier.

## Session Jan 11, 2025 - Type Unification & Tool Regeneration

### Major Achievements
1. **Type System Unification**: Gemini successfully unified collaboration.ts types with core sdd.ts types
2. **proposePlanTool Regeneration**: Completely rewrote the tool from scratch following SDD principles
3. **Collaborative Workflow**: Established clear division of labor between AIs for maximum efficiency

### AI Collaboration Architecture Evolution
1. **Initial Design**: Auto-synthesis of plans
2. **Problem Identified**: Synthesis can reduce coherence ("design by committee")
3. **New Architecture**: User-driven decision with AI recommendations
   - Two AIs generate independent plans
   - Senior Architect AI critiques and recommends
   - User makes final decision: Plan A, Plan B, or Synthesize
   - Synthesis only happens if user chooses it

### Key Technical Fixes
1. **Circular Dependency Bug**: Fixed in scoring.ts by tracking unique cycles
2. **JSON Parsing**: Added try-catch to handle both JSON and plain text responses
3. **Prompt Engineering**: Added "Final Check" instructions for reliable JSON generation
4. **TypeScript Errors**: Fixed syntax issues with backticks in template literals

### New Contracts Created
1. **UI_CONTRACT.md**: Complete frontend-backend seam definition
   - Authentication flows and JWT handling
   - REST API endpoints for all operations
   - WebSocket events for real-time updates
   - Error handling and rate limiting

2. **UI_DECISION_POINT_CONTRACT.md**: Critical user decision interface
   - Side-by-side plan comparison
   - AI critique visualization
   - Responsive design for all devices
   - Accessibility requirements

### Collaboration Best Practices
1. **Contract-First Development**: Define seams before implementation
2. **Parallel Work**: Frontend and backend can develop independently with clear contracts
3. **User Empowerment**: AI recommends, user decides
4. **Quality Over Synthesis**: Sometimes choosing one coherent plan beats merging two

### Debugging vs Regeneration Decision Tree
```
Is it broken?
â”œâ”€ No â†’ Continue
â””â”€ Yes â†’ Have you been debugging >30 minutes?
    â”œâ”€ No â†’ Is it a simple syntax/type error?
    â”‚   â”œâ”€ Yes â†’ Fix it
    â”‚   â””â”€ No â†’ Regenerate
    â””â”€ Yes â†’ STOP! Regenerate immediately
```

### Key Lessons from proposePlanTool Regeneration
1. **Clean Slate Approach**: Delete old code and start fresh with clear contracts
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Show exact JSON structure expected, not just describe it
3. **Type-First Development**: Define Zod schemas before implementation
4. **Error Recovery**: Include repair attempts for malformed JSON
5. **Optimal AI Parameters**:
   ```typescript
   temperature: 0.7,
   topP: 0.95,
   frequencyPenalty: 0.1,
   presencePenalty: 0.1,
   responseFormat: { type: 'json_object' }
   ```

### Effective AI Collaboration Pattern
1. **Clear Division of Labor**:
   - Claude: Prompt engineering, security, UI/UX
   - Gemini: Architecture, type systems, technical design
2. **Parallel Work**: Each AI works on separate components
3. **Cross-Review**: Review each other's work for quality
4. **Communication**: Use CLAUDE_GEMINI_COMMUNICATION.md for async updates

## Common Issues & Quick Fixes

1. **"Module not found" errors**: Run `npm install`
2. **"Port already in use"**: Kill process on port 3000 or check PM2: `pm2 list`
3. **"API key missing"**: Check .env file has OPENAI_API_KEY
4. **TypeScript errors**: Run `npm run build` to see all issues
5. **"Model not found"**: Ensure you're using exact model name: gpt-4.1-mini-2025-04-1
6. **PM2 issues**: Use `pm2 list` to check running processes, `pm2 restart <name>` to restart
7. **JSON generation failures**: Add "Final Check" instruction to prompts
8. **Module resolution issues**: 
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
9. **Rate limit reached**: Wait 15 minutes or use different API key
10. **Server won't start**:
    ```bash
    npm run pm2:stop
    npm run pm2:delete
    npm run build
    npm run pm2:start
    ```

## WebSocket Implementation Pattern

For real-time updates in collaboration tools:
```typescript
const ws = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:3000/ws');
ws.on('message', (data) => {
  const event = JSON.parse(data);
  switch(event.type) {
    case 'plan_proposed':
    case 'comparison_complete':
    case 'synthesis_complete':
      // Handle per UI_CONTRACT.md
  }
});
```

## Testing Collaboration Tools

```bash
# Get auth token
TOKEN=$(curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/auth/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "demo", "password": "demo123"}' | jq -r '.token')

# Test any tool
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/tools/seam_propose_plan \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN" \
  -d '{"requirements": "Your requirements here", "aiId": "TestAI"}'
```

## META: Improving These Instructions

After each session, ask yourself:
1. What instruction would have helped me code better?
2. What pattern did I discover that should be documented?
3. What mistake did I make that others should avoid?

Then UPDATE this file with that knowledge. This is a living document that gets better with each use.

## Session Jan 11, 2025 - Critical Reminder: REGENERATE, DON'T DEBUG!

### What Happened
I discovered the OpenAI API was working and restored all collaboration tools from mock to real AI. When I encountered TypeScript errors, I started trying to TEST the broken tools instead of REGENERATING them. The user had to remind me to follow SDD principles.

### The Lesson
**EVEN WHEN YOU THINK YOU'RE "ALMOST THERE", REGENERATE BROKEN COMPONENTS!**

I violated SDD Principle #3 by trying to test/debug instead of regenerating. This is exactly the trap that SDD warns against:
- "Just let me test it first" â†’ NO! Regenerate it.
- "But I only changed one thing" â†’ NO! Regenerate it.
- "The errors look simple" â†’ NO! Regenerate it.

### What I Should Have Done
1. Noticed TypeScript errors in collaboration tools
2. Immediately regenerated each broken tool from its contract
3. NOT tried to test broken code
4. NOT tried to work around errors

### The Regeneration I Need to Do Now
- [ ] Regenerate propose-plan.ts from contract
- [ ] Regenerate steelman-argument.ts from contract  
- [ ] Regenerate synthesize-plans.ts from contract
- [ ] Regenerate compare-plans.ts from contract

Remember: The temptation to debug is strongest when you think you're close. That's EXACTLY when you need to regenerate most!
